## Notes
- I provided the source code as .ipynb and .py
- I provided an exe file if you need to use it in that way in the zip file.
- The exe file is compatible with pytube version 10.8.2
- This project was made for personal uses and needs, so I set it up for my personal prefrences, and you can put yours as you like as I provided these features in the file documentation, so feel free to go.
- I didn't depend on the best code practice or catching errors for this project as I added the features along different times, in addition to that the project is for personal uses, so there were no need to pay more extra time.
